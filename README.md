## Exercise 1: File and Directory Management

### **Challenge:**
1. Create a new directory called `DevOpsScripts` in your userâ€™s home folder.
2. Inside `DevOpsScripts`, create a text file named `log.txt` and write `"Log initialized at [current timestamp]"` inside it.
3. Copy `log.txt` to a new file called `backup-log.txt`.
4. Display the contents of both files.
5. Delete `backup-log.txt` and confirm it's removed.

### **Expected Outcome:**
- A directory named `DevOpsScripts` is created.
- `log.txt` contains a log message with a timestamp.
- `backup-log.txt` is created as a copy of `log.txt`.
- Both files' contents are displayed.
